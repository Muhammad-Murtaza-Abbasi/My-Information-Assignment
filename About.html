    </center>
    <center>
        <p>Imran Khan (born October 5, 1952, Lahore, Pakistan) is an antiestablishment politician in Pakistan who in
            2022 became the first prime minister (2018–22) to be removed by a parliamentary vote. He rose to fame as a
            cricket player who led Pakistan’s national team to a Cricket World Cup victory in 1992. He later entered
            politics as a critic of government corruption in Pakistan, although he faced corruption charges of his own
            in 2022 after falling out with the politically powerful army.
